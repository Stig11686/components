            <p>Have a think about the below ideas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pendant lights / striking light fixtures</li>
                    <li>Lighting can brighten up your entire kitchen &nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            <p>You can never have enough lighting in a kitchen!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being organised</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Being organised is a must in a small kitchen, when space is at a premium being organised inside your cabinets is needed, use storage trays, boxes to keep everything tidy and keeping all your worktops minimalist as this can enhance space making it feel larger</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Painting & Tiling</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Using lighter colours can help visualise expansion! Even choosing lighter worktops will help with that space feel, making it feel more open.</p>
